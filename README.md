# Used-cars-Price-prediction
I have a dataset of Used cars with the different variables such as 'Name', 'Location', 'Year', 'Kilometers_Driven', 'Fuel_Type', 'Transmission', 'Owner_Type', 'Mileage', 'Engine', 'Power', 'Seats' and 'Price' and I will be performing Exploratory Data Analysis on it to get some insights. You'll get to see it in the file 'Used_car_EDA'.
There is PPT in which you'll get to see the isights of EDA. Which are how every variable affects the price of a car.
Then I have build a predictive model which can help you predict the price of a car if you provide it with certain features.
You can checkout the model building in the file 'Used_car_Model'.
